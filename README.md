A demo that shows the security of SGX.
- ([nosgx/](nosgx/) shows that given a normal execuable, the host with root privileges can examine the memory content (and hence any senstive data) of the execuable.
- ([sgx/](sgx/) demonstrates that for the case of SGX, the host with the root privileges cannot access the memory content under protection of SGX.
